# VulcanLogic.Core
Lean Math Proofs about Finite Dynamics to help A.i. reason about complex systems

# How to Use
//to do  create master import file
While the files are deceptive in their generic math nature, the basic assumption is if you have parts that are interacting here is the mathematical consequences. But how you use it is that you treat it as a mathematical superposition ready to shift to biology, ecology, network theory, physics, sociology, medical research, engineering research, A.i. development, ... the nature of the Logic Core is that its assumptions off first principle are generic enough to apply to almost everything, but the results are powerful enough to be highly meaningful for every field. 

# Narrative Encoded

From the first asymmetric logistic map to the final phase cascade, VulcanLogic.Core tells a single coherent story:Calibrated asymmetry expands optionality and stabilizes cooperation.  
Tension spiders are the minimal processors that implement this principle.  
Hybrid metamorphosis allows phase transitions between rigid, fluid, and critical regimes.  
Finite nested hierarchies with timescale separation force a phase cascade from below: the fastest dynamics lock Diamond or Liquid first, creating the environment within which all slower layers live.  
Sustained chaos (Plasma) is impossible in finite worlds.  
Therefore, resilient multi-scale systems are inevitably Liquid — cooperative, cyclic, heterogeneous, alive.
